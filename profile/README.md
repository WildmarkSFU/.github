# TEAM WLDMK (Wildmark)

We are a programming team of 5 enrolled in CMPT 276 (Intro to Software Engineering) in SFU Surrey Campus. The purpose of us forming is to create a project that will benefit a community or a client. By doing so, we will have more experience in the work field. The creation of our team name is inspired by the show RWBY.
